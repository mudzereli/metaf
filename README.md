# Porkchop's Asheron's Call Metas

This is a compilation of Metas for Asheron's Call. Most of these are written by me. 

*A few of them are written by others with modifications by me (noted in the documentation below).*

Compiled Metas (.met) are in the `compiled` folder. 

Source files are in [MetaF](https://github.com/JJEII/metaf) syntax (.af) and located in the `source` folder.

## General Requirements
> [!CAUTION]
> * All Metas Require [Virindi Tank](http://virindi.net/plugins/) (latest version)
> * All Metas Require [Utility Belt](https://utilitybelt.gitlab.io) (latest version)

> [!WARNING]
> * Most Metas require Aphus Lassel Recall. This is because Aphus Lassel gives a very quick route to Town Network from anywhere.
> * Most Metas work better if you buff beforehand. This can prevent characters from getting out of sync due to buffing or dying due to buffs falling off.
> * Most Metas work better if you put your characters into a fellow beforehand.
> * Most Metas are started with `/ub bc /vt meta load <meta name>`
